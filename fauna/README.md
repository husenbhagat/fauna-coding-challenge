To run the code:

1. From `fauna` run `node tests/test_ExecutionOrder`
2. If you want to add your own data, you can add a new .txt file in the `tests/data` folder, and re run `node tests/test_ExecutionOrder`.
3. Multiple files can be added in the data folder, and running `node tests/test_ExecutionOrder` will print the output for each test case in every file.
